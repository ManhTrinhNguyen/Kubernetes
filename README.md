# Kubernetes 

## Big Picture 

**What is Kubernetes ?**
  - Open source container tool developed by Google
  - Kubernetes help manage Applications that are that made up of hundreds or maybe thousands of Containers in the Differents Environment like ( Physical Machine, Virtual Machine, or Cloud Enviroment)

**What is problems Kubernetes solve ?**
  - Trends from Monolith to Microservices
  - The Rise of Microservices Technology increased usage of Container Technology bcs the Container offer perfect host for small independent applications, like microservices
  - And the Rise of Container resulted in Application they are now comprised 100 or 1000 of container Managing those container accross multiple Environment using script and self make tools can be really complex

**What features do Orchestration tools offer ?**
  - High Availability | No down time
  - Scalability | high performance (I can scale my App fast when I more load on it and more user trying to access it, scale down when user go down)
  - Recovery Disaster

## Main component

### Commnucation between Pods

**Node and Pod**
```
  - Node = Server, Virtual or Physic Machine
  - Pod : Basic component or smallest unit of Kubernetes
    - Pod is a abstraction over container
    - What Pod does is create running Environment or layer on top of the container . The reason is bcs Kubernetes want to abstract away the container runtime or container technologies so i can replace them. I don't have to work with docker or other container technologies
    - Only interact with Kubernets layer
  - 1 Application per Pod
  - Each Pod get its own IP address
  - Pod are ephemeral which mean they can die very easily
  - Bcs Pod easy to die and everytime it died the new Pod create with new IP . So inconvinient that when My app talk to DB via IP so I have Service and Ingress
```

**Service and Ingress**
```
  Service:
    - Service is Static IP address or permannet IP can be attach to each Pod
    - Lifecyle of Pod and Service not connected
    - External Service :
      - Make a App to accessable from Browser
      - External service is service that open the commnunication from external sources
    - Internal Service:
      - For only insde connection like (DB or ...)

  Ingress:
    - Instead of services the request first go to Ingress and then service
    - DNS 
```

### External Configuration 

**ConigMap and Secrect**
```
  ConfigMap:
    - External configuration of the Application
      - Usually contain configuration data like URLs of database or some other services that you use
      - In Kubernetes, I just connect it to the pod so that pod acctually gets the data that config map contain . Now you change the name of the service and endpoint of the service I just need adjust the config map
      - Part of external Config can be username and password which may also change
      - But config map is non-confidental data only so I have Secrect

  Secret:
    - Secret just like config map but the different is used to store secret data in base 64 encoded format
    - But base 64 encoded format not secure so I use third party tools (tools from cloud provider or kubernetes)
    - All the data that i don't want to expose will go in Secret
    - Then i use this secrect to connect with my App . My app can get data from secrect as ENV 
```

### Data Persistence

**Volumes**
```
  Data Storage:
    - Need the way to persisted data when a database a gone or down
  How is it work ?
    - It attaches a physical storage on the hard drive to my Pod
    - And that storage ethier from the local machine meaning on the same server where the pod is running, or it could be on remote storage meaning outside of Kubernetes cluster ( could be cloud storage or my own premise storage )

  The Different between the Kubernetes cluster and all of its components and the storage
    - Regardless of whether it is a local or remote storage, think of the storage as a external hard drive plugged in into the Kubernetes cluster 
```

### Pod Blueprint | Replication Mechanism 

**Deployment and Stateful Set**
```
  - When everything work and Application can access through a browser but what if my Application Pod died ? That mean downtime happen and I don't want this happen . I take advantage of distributed system and container .
  - So instead of relying on just one application pod and one database etc ... I replicate everthing on multiple server with also connected to service

Deployment:
  - Deployment is Service also the load balancer which mean the service actually catch the request and forward it to whichever pod is least busy
  - In other to create this second replica of the My application pod i wouldn't create a second pod . but instead i would define a blueprint for my Application pod and specify how many replicas of that pod, you would like to run. So that blueprint call Deployment .
  - In Practice I would not working with Pod or I would not creating Pod . I would creating Deployment, bcs I can specify how many replicas I want, and I can scale up or scale down number of replica of pods that I need
  - Pod is abstraction on top of the Container . and Deployment is abstraction on top on Pod which make it more convinience replication and do other replication
  - However I can not replicate DB using the Deployment the reason is DB have states which is its data . That mean I have clone DB they would need to access the same shared data storage and there I would need some kind of mechanism that manages which pods are currently writing to that storage or which pods are reading that storage in order to avoid data incosistence and that mechanism, in addition replicating feature is offered by another component called Statefull Set

Statefull set:
  - This components meant specificiclly for Application like Database or any order Statefull Application should be created by using Statefull Set and Not Deployment
  - And Statefull set is just like Deployment would take care of replicating the pods and scaling them up or scaling them down, but make sure the database read and write are synchronized so that no database inconsistencies are offered 
  - However Deploy DB application using Statefull Set in Kubernetes cluster can be so hard . Common practice to host DB outside of the Kubenetes cluster and just have a deployment or Stateless Application that replicate and scale with no problem inside of Kubernetes cluster 
!!! Deployment = Stateless App | Statefull set = Statefull App or Database
```

**Daemon Set:** 
```
  - Daemon Set is Kubernetes Component, just like a deployment or stateful Set with the different that it automatically calculate how many replica of Apps it should deploy depending on how many Node .
  - It is also deploy just one Pod or 1 Replica on each Node in the cluster
  - So when I added new Node it will automatically Pod replica there and when I remove Node it will remove Replica pod
```
